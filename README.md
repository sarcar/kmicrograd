# kmicrograd
A small micrograd library with a bite!

This is not a fork of Andrej Karpathy's micrograd repository, but a **heavily** influenced copy. The 'k' in kmicrograd is an homage to the original author.
I wrote this library to clear up some fuzzy concepts, as a learning aid, from Karpathy's excellent tutorial.
